##Snap Engineering Academy Project Assessment

Name: Mark Nguyen
<br>Task: Create a website for a small business in LA

I chose to create my version of the fast food burger restaurant "The Win-Dow" located in Venice Beach.

Link to GitHub Pages: https://wixair.github.io/snapApplication/index.html

##Recommended Features for first time creating a website (all):

✅ About the Business section
<br>✅ Images and descriptions of 3-4 items/services offered
<br>✅ A CSS file for styling your website. Use this file to change the color palette and fonts for your website; they cannot be the same as the ones from a template if you choose to use one.
<br>✅ At least one HTML button
<br>✅ Use of GitHub Pages or Netlify to host your website

##3 Additional features I chose to implement:

✅ Use of JavaScript
<br>✅ A photo gallery
<br>✅ Navigation menu and multiple pages

No templates were used.
