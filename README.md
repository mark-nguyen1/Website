# **Snap Engineering Academy Project Assessment**

Name: Mark Nguyen
<br>Task: Create a website for a small business in LA

I chose to create my version of the fast food burger restaurant "The Win-Dow" located in Venice Beach.

## **Recommended Features for first time creating a website (all):**

✅ About the Business section
<br>✅ Images and descriptions of 3-4 items/services offered
<br>✅ A CSS file for styling your website. 
<br>✅ At least one HTML button
<br>✅ Use of GitHub Pages or Netlify to host your website

## **3 Additional features I chose to implement:**

✅ Use of JavaScript
<br>✅ A photo gallery
<br>✅ Navigation menu and multiple pages

No templates were used.
